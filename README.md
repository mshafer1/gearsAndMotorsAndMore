2. Our program is a tool for designers of gear boxes for example FIRST teams to use in designing robots. It has a sandbox where users can drag in motors and gears in the order they appear in their gear box as well as inputing a couple other attributes about their robot. The program will then output if the robot will move or not and the robot's max speed.
